                    <p>Assets sharing and inviting team members are great predictors in users converting (becoming becoming paid customers), however the current experience can leave many users confused and frustrated. We try to tackle that by simplifying the sharing process as well as adding a new powerful feature called Published Views</p>

                <p>Our activation rate has been used to determine how well our app is doing for new users. We came to the realization that activation rate is not sensitive to new changes and updates in the app, and not a great predictor of user conversion (free to paid). With the help of our research, we came up with the activation score, an aggregate way of calculating the user engagement based on what activities they do (in the first 7 and 30 days).</p>
                <p>Adding a user and sharing were two of the main events that scored very high, and were a leading indicator of conversion.</p>
