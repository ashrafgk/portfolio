                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Assets sharing and inviting team members are great predictors in users converting (becoming becoming paid customers), however the current experience can leave many users confused and frustrated. We try to tackle that by simplifying the sharing process as well as adding a new powerful feature called Published Views</p>

            <div class="gap-south-xl">
                <p>Our activation rate has been used to determine how well our app is doing for new users. We came to the realization that activation rate is not sensitive to new changes and updates in the app, and not a great predictor of user conversion (free to paid). With the help of our research, we came up with the activation score, an aggregate way of calculating the user engagement based on what activities they do (in the first 7 and 30 days).</p>
                <p>Adding a user and sharing were two of the main events that scored very high, and were a leading indicator of conversion.</p>

                <p>After looking at the data, and evaluating the current user experience, we came to the following conclusions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding user is a hidden part of the app, and the sharing button isn't called out enough. </li>
                    <li>Misleading labels and inability to invite users through the sharing of an assets.</li>
                    <li>If a user has not been invited to the account, you are unable to simply just enter their email to invite/share with them</li>
                    <li>Get a link is a solution the does not work if a user is not already a part of the account</li>
                    <li>Sharing a dashboard where not all the metrics are also shared is disappointing experience and can occur very easily.</li>
                    <li>If a user has already an account, you are unable to share with them or invite them to be part of your company. Resulting in a dead-end and a frustrating experience</li>
